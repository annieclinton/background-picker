# YouTube Background Picker

This dynamic web application is designed to assist YouTubers in choosing the ideal background color or image for their video setups. By providing a range of colorful backgrounds and fun themes, like a 'space cat' image, users can instantly visualize how different backgrounds might look in their videos.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

 HTML structures the page, CSS handles the presentation, and JavaScript enables interactive functionalities. Users interact with a set of options displayed as clickable list items that change the background of a preview area to reflect their selection.

I developed a straightforward user interface that allows instant visual feedback for each background choice. JavaScript is used to handle user events and dynamically update the webpage's background based on the user's choice.

## Optimizations

- Enhanced Responsiveness to accommodate various devices and screen sizes.

- Increased Background Variety: Addition of more background options and perhaps user customization features where users can upload and preview their own images. 

## Lessons Learned:

The project was an excellent exercise in combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly, interactive web application. It provided insights into the practical application of event listeners and DOM manipulation.
